# CS230 - Building Energy Forecasting with Physics-Informed Neural Networks

**Team Members:** Alisha Chulani, Vaishnavi Thumuganti, and Naomie Sandra Chien

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Location:** `benchmark_building_eda.py`
- Contains analysis of the IDEAL dataset, context window optimization, and temporal dependency evaluation

### Baseline Model
- **Location:** `scripts/transfer_learning_lightgbm_fixed.py`
- LightGBM baseline reproduction following BuildingsBench protocol
- Implements autoregressive forecasting with 168-hour context window

### Results and Analysis
- **Location:** `results/` directory
- Performance metrics, comparative analysis, and visualization scripts
